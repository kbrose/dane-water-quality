If a model could say when a beach that is high has gone low again, that could encourage people to go out and do qPCR testing

Or on things like a Friday, encourage a qPCR b/c no one wants to come in on a Saturday to read results.

qPCR 5x more expensive
Requires calibration period/test run (so becomes more cost effective with more beaches tested at once)

Clean beach corridor beaches:
Mendota county park
Goodland county park
Bernie's park

Good to publish data

BG Algae is a faster test
